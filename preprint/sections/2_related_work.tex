\subsection{Discrete Flow models}
\label{subsec:related_discrete_flow_models}
\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}


The concept of Flow Matching~\citep{Lipman:2023FlowMatching} has recently been extended to the discrete flow-based models~\citep{Gat:2024DFM,Campbell:2024MultiFlow,Sahoo:2024MDLM,Schiff:2025UDLM}, demonstrating its flexibility across high-dimensional and structured data~\citep{Bai:2025meissonic,Chang:2022maskgit,Weber:2024maskbit,Arriola:2025blockdiffusion,Nie:2025largeldm,Yu:2023magvit,Lee:2025genmol,Campbell:2024MultiFlow,Wang:2025drakes}.
Among these, uniform-state models~\citep{Sahoo:2025Duo,Schiff:2025UDLM} have been studied for their self-correcting properties, which enable recovery from errors introduced during parallel decoding. However, their performance degrades markedly in few-step settings, posing a key limitation for efficient generation under tight compute budgets.

\subsection{Accelerating Discrete Flow models}
\label{subsec:related_discrete_rectified_flow}
\vspace{-0.5\baselineskip}

Several approaches have been proposed to accelerate sampling with DFMs.~\citet{Park:2025jumpyoursteps} directly optimize sampling timesteps for improved parallelism while mitigating decoding errors.~\citet{Hayakawa:2025di4c} highlight the importance of capturing dimensional correlations for faster sampling and introduce mixture models to this end, at the cost of additional loss terms that complicate optimization. Another line of work adapts techniques from continuous domains, as in~\citet{Sahoo:2025Duo}, that propose a discrete analogue of Consistency Distillation (CD)~\citep{Song:2023consistency} by leveraging the duality between uniform-state and continuous Gaussian models. Most relevant to our approach is ReDi~\citep{Yoo:2025ReDi}, which draws inspiration from the concept of straight flows in ReFlow~\citep{Liu:2023RF} and iteratively optimizes pairs of data and noise samples.
